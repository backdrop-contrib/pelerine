# Pelerine

Dress up your Backdrop website with a fancy cape.

Set a strong color statement with one of the included background images or create a
custom subtheme.

Easy to configure (just a single setting does it all).

Easy to extend, a starterkit subtheme is included.

To make a custom subtheme, unzip pelerine-starterkit.zip in your themes
folder, alongside the other themes. Then enable your theme.

Add your custom image in the backgrounds directory of pelerine_sub and customize the
capes.css file as needed.
